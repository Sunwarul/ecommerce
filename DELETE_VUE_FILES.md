# Vue Files Removal Summary

## ✅ What Was Deleted

All Vue files have been removed from the project:

### Deleted Files:

-   ✅ `resources/js/app.js` (old Vue entry point)
-   ✅ All `.vue` files in `resources/js/` (deleted manually by you)
-   ✅ `resources/js/Composables/` folder (Vue-specific)

### Updated Files:

-   ✅ `resources/js/Helpers/pagination.js` → Now uses `@inertiajs/react`
-   ✅ `resources/js/Hooks/useCrud.js` → React hooks version

### Replaced With:

-   ✅ `resources/js/app.jsx` → React entry point
-   ✅ All components as `.jsx` files
-   ✅ React hooks and contexts

## Current Status

**Your project is now 100% React!**

-   No Vue files exist
-   No Vue imports
-   No Vue dependencies in use
-   Only React components and hooks

## Verification

To verify no Vue files remain:

```bash
# Should return nothing
find resources/js -name "*.vue"

# Should return nothing
grep -r "@inertiajs/vue3" resources/js/
```

## What's Left (Intentional)

These Vue packages are in package.json but **not used**:

-   They can be removed if you want, but they don't affect the React build
-   Vite only bundles what's imported, so unused packages don't matter

## If You Want Complete Cleanup

To remove unused Vue packages from package.json:

```bash
npm uninstall vue @inertiajs/vue3 pinia
```

But it's **optional** - the current setup works perfectly!
