Awesome—since you’ve locked the stack (Laravel 11+, Vue 3, Inertia 2, PrimeVue, Tailwind, MySQL, Eloquent-first), here’s a full technical breakdown turned into a sprint-by-sprint plan. It’s organized to reduce risk, front-load foundations (auth, RBAC, branch scoping, product model) and then layer business flows (purchasing → inventory → sales → EMI → returns → service → reporting). Each sprint lists: scope, DB/migrations, backend, frontend, and DoD (definition of done). You can run ~1–2 weeks per sprint depending on team size.

Architecture & Cross-Cutting Conventions (apply from Sprint 0 onward)
• Repo layout
◦ app/Domain/<BoundedContext> (e.g., Inventory, Sales, Purchasing, CRM, Accounting, Auth)
◦ app/Http/Controllers/<Context>, app/Http/Requests/..., app/Policies/...
◦ app/Models (use UUIDs or ULIDs), database/migrations, database/seeders
◦ resources/js (Inertia pages in Pages/<Context>, components in Components, composables in composables)
◦ resources/css (Tailwind), resources/js/plugins/primevue.ts
• Core packages (recommended)
◦ spatie/laravel-permission (RBAC)
◦ spatie/laravel-activitylog (audit)
◦ spatie/laravel-medialibrary (product images/attachments)
◦ laravel/horizon (queues) + Redis
◦ laravel/telescope (dev diagnostics, disable in prod)
• Multi-branch scoping
◦ Every tenant-owned row has branch_id (nullable for global).
◦ BranchContext middleware resolves active branch from user selection (header/switcher).
◦ Global scopes (e.g., BelongsToBranch trait) to auto-filter by branch_id where appropriate.
• Soft deletes, created_by/updated_by, activity log on all critical models.
• Validation via Form Requests, authorization via Policies, Resource classes for API responses.
• Error strategy: domain exceptions → handler maps to 4xx/5xx.
• I18n-ready: text via lang files.
• Testing: Pest or PHPUnit; HTTP + model + feature tests per sprint.

• Runbooks, admin manuals, data dictionary, API docs (scribe/openapi optional).
• Monitoring & alerting (health checks, queue lag, error rates).
DoD
• Production live; runbook + manuals delivered; owners trained.

Entity Map (high-level)
• Org/Access: branches, users, roles, permissions, branch_user
• Catalog: brands, categories, units, taxes, attributes, attribute_values, products, product_variants, media
• Inventory: stocks, stock_ledger_entries, stock_adjustments, stock_transfers, reservations
• Purchasing: suppliers, purchase_orders, grns, purchase_invoices, purchase_returns, expenses
• Sales/CRM: customers, sales, sale_lines, payments, sales_returns, exchanges, store_credits
• EMI: emi_plans, emi_contracts, emi_schedules, emi_receipts
• Service: warranty_registrations, service_tickets, service_actions, rma
• Accounting: accounts, journals, journal_lines
• Comms: notification_templates, notification_jobs, user_contact_channels
• System: imports, backups, activity_log, inventory_settings

API/Route Examples (pattern)
• Web (Inertia): Route::resource('branches', ...), Route::prefix('inventory')->group(...)
• Service classes per context (e.g., Inventory\StockLedger, Sales\PosService, EMI\Scheduler)
• Policies: ProductPolicy, SalePolicy…; Gates for feature flags.

UI/UX Guidelines (PrimeVue + Tailwind)
• Data-heavy pages: PrimeVue DataTable (virtual scroll, server pagination, column filters, CSV export).
• Forms: <FormKit> optional or custom composables, PrimeVue form inputs, validation via VeeValidate/Yup.
• State: Pinia stores for session/branch, POS cart, notifications.
• Feedback: Toasts for success/errors, ConfirmDialog for destructive ops.
• Theming: Tailwind base + PrimeVue preset; dark mode toggle.

Testing Strategy (each sprint)
• Feature tests: happy paths per flow (create PO→GRN→Invoice; POS cash sale; EMI receipt).
• Policy tests: branch scoping & role permissions.
• Model tests: stock ledger math, amortization correctness.
• Browser tests: Laravel Dusk or Cypress (key flows: POS checkout, GRN, transfer).

Sequencing Rationale 1. Foundation first (auth, RBAC, branch scoping) avoids rework. 2. Catalog → Inventory before purchasing/sales ensures stock coherency. 3. Purchasing precedes Sales so costs/stock are correct. 4. EMI after POS because it depends on sales and payments. 5. Returns/Service build on completed sales/warranty data. 6. Notifications after dues/EMI/warranty exist. 7. Transfers after you trust stock math. 8. Accounting once operational journals can map deterministically. 9. Dashboards/Reports once truth sources stabilize. 10. Import/Export last to avoid schema churn. 11. Hardening/Deploy when features are stable.

If you want, I can convert this into a clickable Jira (epics → stories → tasks) dump or a markdown backlog ready to paste into your tracker, plus starter migration/model stubs for Sprint 1–3.
